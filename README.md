# Broadcaster
Broadcaster is a module that allows you to screen-spectate other players. Targeted for Mouse & Keyboard use only.

## Installation
You can install Broadcaster through the latest release's `.rbxm` file or grab it on ROBLOX's creator store.

## Dependencies
Broadcaster heavily relies on [ByteNet](https://github.com/ffrostfall/ByteNet) to allow for optimized
client-to-server communications.
Currently using a [modified version](https://github.com/ffrostfall/ByteNet/issues/15#issuecomment-2166659516) of v0.4.3 since the version doesn't work for CFrames.
